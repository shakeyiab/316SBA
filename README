#SBA 316: The Document Object Model

 

# I have created a single page website measuring my understanding of the Document #Object Model (DOM) and my capability to implement its features in a practical manner.

#I have decided to build a iPhone dealer website providing history of iphones, low phone plans and iphone sales
#strictly iphone usage no andriods round here!
#upon accessing my website the client can access the nav bar and search for products in the search engine to #the right of the nav bar if they mouse over the submit button they would be able to witness the button change #from submit 
# the background of my website a gif of iphone immediately under the search bar the 
#client will see a welcome banner providing more options under and the option to 
#chose a plan, once the #client choose to choose a plan an alert will generate alerting
 #the client that they will be leaving this page
#Starting from the far left hand sid the client can read more info on our internet service, they have the 
#option of purchasing online or contactings a rep
#to the right of the internt card is the team iphone card which gives you the evolution of iphones and if you click the checkbox itll print a discount code to use at check out
# in the middle is a card verifying if your an andriod user, once clicked a message will come up asking if the client wants to stay and confirming we only sale apple products
#the furthest right card is a mini diagram of a iphone purchase, this is only asking for the gb of desired iphone, a choice is required before submission if client doesnt provide answer then an error message will generate
